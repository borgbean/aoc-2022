# Advent of code 2022 solutions

## Running solutions
Add a AOC_SESSION_COOKIE variable into a .env file in the root directory of the project, populated with your advent of code cookie. Then, simply run the .go file in a problem folder. It will automatically download your input and spit out the solutions.

## Background
I think advent of code is fun, and I'm trying to learn Go. I'm not very good at Go, so expect very verbose solutions :). I've made no effort to be terse, but to be at least somewhat performant.
